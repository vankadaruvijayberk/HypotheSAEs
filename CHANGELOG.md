# Changelog

New version releases for HypotheSAEs will be documented here.

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed
- Fixed interpretation precision metric computation.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-08

### Changed
- LLM requests now use the OpenAI Responses API via a unified inference path for all models.
- Added `OPENAI_BASE_URL` support so OpenAI-compatible endpoints (e.g., vLLM server mode) can be used without separate local-model routing.
- Annotation and interpretation now accept flexible request kwargs (for example `reasoning_effort`, `verbosity`, and token controls) instead of hard-coding model-specific argument branches.
- Updated default interpreter/annotator model names to `gpt-5.2` and `gpt-5-mini`.
- Local OpenAI-compatible endpoints no longer require `OPENAI_KEY_SAE` when `OPENAI_BASE_URL` points to a non-OpenAI host.
- Interpretation/annotation defaults were relaxed for compatibility with thinking models: no timeout is applied unless explicitly requested, token clamps were removed, and parsing now tolerates reasoning output.
- Local quickstart notebooks and tests were refreshed around the unified API flow and current Qwen local-model defaults.
- Local embedding setup now enables high float32 matmul precision for better throughput on supported GPUs.
- Removed the older in-process `vllm` inference path; local usage now goes through OpenAI-compatible serving only.

### Added
- Optional test coverage for local OpenAI-compatible endpoints (guarded by `RUN_LOCAL_OPENAI_TEST=1`).

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-29

1. Previously we had some dependency issues with scipy and Python 3.13, these seem to have been fix, so package install now allows 3.13.
2. Fixed a couple of bugs that arose from changing versions of HypotheSAEs in the test scripts, so the tests should now work with `pytest -v tests/`.
3. Fixed some vLLM bugs.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-15

Incrementing to 1.0.0 because multi-SAE hypothesis generation has been removed, in favor of Matryoshka SAEs.

### Added
- Support for Batch Top-K sparsity in SAEs (off by default)

### Changed
- The repo no longer supports passing in multiple SAE models to `generate_hypotheses()` or other quickstart functions. Training multiple SAEs is mostly deprecated by Matryoshka SAEs. It is also not hard to implement hypothesis generation with multiple SAEs, if you would like.

## [0.3.1] - 2025-08-28

### Changed
- Avoid reloading OpenAI client on each completion
- Cache prompts to avoid reopening file each time

### Fixed
- Bug in displaying neuron prevalences

## [0.3.0] - 2025-07-28

### Added
- `quickstart_local.ipynb` notebook to get started with local LLMs
- `local_llm_experiments` contains experiments benchmarking local LLMs for autointerp and concept annotation

### Changed
- `interpret_neurons.py`, `annotate.py`, `requirements.txt` modified to support local LLM inference
- `quickstart.ipynb` notebook now uses matryoshka SAE by default

### Fixed
- `requirements.txt` forces scipy==1.15.3 to avoid bug with Python 3.13

## [0.2.0] - 2025-05-03

### Added
- Matryoshka SAEs: https://github.com/rmovva/HypotheSAEs/pull/1

### Fixed
- Account for the changed parameter name `print_examples_n` in `quickstart.interpret_sae()` (from `print_examples`) in the `quickstart.ipynb` notebook.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-04-22

### Added
- Basic unit tests for embeddings and quickstart functions

### Changed
- Add param for users to include more characters when printing examples in `quickstart.interpret_sae()`
- Only catch API errors for timeout + rate limit errors

### Fixed
- Ensure that in `sae.get_activations()` and all functions in `quickstart.py`, we never load the full dataset onto the GPU
- When sampling examples in `interpret_neurons.py`, we handle the case where there are not enough examples to sample

## [0.0.5] - 2025-03-18

This was the initial release of HypotheSAEs (with small bug fixes).
